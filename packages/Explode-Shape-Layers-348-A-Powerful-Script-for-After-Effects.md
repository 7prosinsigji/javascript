You can download the script from [aescripts.com](https://aescripts.com/explode-shape-layers/) for $29.99 or try it for free for a limited time. Once you have the script, you need to copy it to your ScriptUI Panels folder in your After Effects directory[^1^]. Then, you can activate the script from the Window menu in After Effects.
 
The script has a simple and intuitive interface that consists of six buttons: Explode, Merge, Convert, Remove Artboard, Select Fills, and Select Strokes[^1^]. Each button has a different function that we will explain below.
 
### Explode
 
The Explode button allows you to split a shape layer into individual layers, each containing one shape[^1^]. This is useful if you want to animate or edit each shape separately or access their properties more easily. To use this feature, you need to select the shape layer you want to explode and click the Explode button. You can also choose to explode only the selected shapes within a shape layer by holding Shift while clicking the button[^1^].
 
### Merge
 
The Merge button allows you to combine multiple shape layers into one layer[^1^]. This is useful if you want to simplify your composition or apply effects or transformations to all shapes at once. To use this feature, you need to select the shape layers you want to merge and click the Merge button. You can also choose to merge only the selected shapes within multiple shape layers by holding Shift while clicking the button[^1^].
 
### Convert
 
The Convert button allows you to convert a vector layer (such as an Illustrator file) into a shape layer[^1^]. This is useful if you want to edit or animate the vector shapes in After Effects without losing quality or resolution. To use this feature, you need to select the vector layer you want to convert and click the Convert button. The script will automatically remove any empty artboards that may come with the vector file[^1^].
 
### Remove Artboard
 
The Remove Artboard button allows you to delete any empty artboards that may appear when you import a vector file into After Effects[^1^]. This is useful if you want to clean up your composition and avoid unnecessary layers. To use this feature, you need to select the vector layer that contains the empty artboard and click the Remove Artboard button.
 
### Select Fills and Select Strokes
 
The Select Fills and Select Strokes buttons allow you to select all fills or all strokes in your composition with one click[^1^]. This is useful if you want to change the color or style of all fills or strokes at once. To use these features, you need to click the Select Fills or Select Strokes button. You can also hold Shift while clicking the button to select only the fills or strokes that match the color of the selected layer[^1^].
